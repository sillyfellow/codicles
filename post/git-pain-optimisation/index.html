    <p>I have been thinking a bit about git and the tools that help us with
it.</p>
<p>Git is a super powerful tool, but with quite complicated ways of
working.</p>
<p>And to most of the developers, the interface in the command line is
hard.</p>
<p>That usually leads them to using some UI which claims to make things
easier by abstracting details away (that is, the UI claims to do
the magic).</p>
<p>All what I have seen so far tells me that this results in quite
unexpected behaviour (well, funnily enough sometimes we don&rsquo;t even
know what is the expected behaviour). And every time this unexpected
things come along, one has to spend a good amount of time to fix it
(and that is possible only with the CLI)</p>
<p>To make it worse for me, in most of the projects I&rsquo;m in, the person
who bears this pain is yours truly.</p>
<p>This is mainly because the developers of the UI tool are probably
confused too, and finds it hard to communicate with the users
correctly - resulting in a tool which claims to do magic, but performs
the wrong trick.</p>
<p>The one and only solution I have seen which works (not claiming it is
easy), and completely avoids all or any kind of surprise is the git
command line.</p>
<p>I use perhaps 2% of the power of git, but only from CLI and
very very rarely do I end up in a soup.</p>
<p>My regular pain is probably ever so little more than the pain of the
UI tool user. But that is my worst pain, but never do I have to suffer
anything worse.</p>
<p>So, please go ahead and learn those 10 git cli commands and get out of
the habit of using a fancy tool which merges in the wrong direction or
rebases incorrectly to drive you mad. That&rsquo;ll pay off and keep your
pain minimal.</p>
