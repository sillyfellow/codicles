    <p>Every now and then I have to create a new server. Sometimes in Python, sometimes in Javascript (lately more Typescript), sometimes it is Go. Rarely Rails (at least lately). Over time, the following are my self-inflicted requirements for a nice server. Just putting it out here for future reference. Also, I might just create a series about creating such a server (perhaps in Golang?)</p>
<ol>
<li>Database connection/s
<ul>
<li>of course at least one type should be configured.</li>
<li>but possibly with choice of environments - develop on psql, testing on sqlite (for example)
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve found it quite nice to have local tests that can be run on against an in-memory sqlite DB</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Migration (either automatic on start, or with a simple trigger)
<ul>
<li>CRUD for entities, and similar things</li>
<li>NOTE that this might get tricky with ability to run against different DBs.
<ul>
<li>In conflict, I think we stick with the DB of our choice and migrations win</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>/health endpoint
<ul>
<li>Should return something like <code>{ status: &quot;Ok&quot;, db_ping: &quot;43ns&quot;, version: &quot;x.yy.zzz&quot; }</code></li>
<li>The DB ping is quite useful at times (if you ping takes longer, you can directly see there&rsquo;s a bit of load there)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NO global variables (must I explain?)</li>
<li>NOTHING hardcoded
<ul>
<li>Env variables are to be read only in the main (entry method)</li>
<li>And proper dependency injection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swagger <strong>generated with annotations</strong>, not with a large yaml/json file
<ul>
<li>Would love if it is a smart/er system which generates from code itself ;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One method <em>createServer(params)</em> should return
<ul>
<li>a server we can run, and</li>
<li>a shutDownServer which will gracefully shut things down
<ul>
<li>(optional) proper disconnection from DB as well</li>
<li>And to be called when we receive signals to die/kill</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Middle/After-ware which logs
<ul>
<li>Request arrival
<ul>
<li>possibility to turn on body/header logging</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Request completion with time taken
<ul>
<li>possibility to turn on output logging</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The possibility to add an arbitrary middleware
<ul>
<li>For example, something to add a dummy-header to the request.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unit tests
<ul>
<li>Anything which is NOT an api call should be testable with unit tests
<ul>
<li>(optional) If possible the migration method should be tested too</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration/API tests
<ul>
<li>All apis should be testable (/health included)
<ul>
<li>Test the response code, and verify with another call, but not by looking into DB.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create database at start</li>
<li>Connect to database (in memory is fine too)</li>
<li>NO tests shall call endpoints directly with path.
<ul>
<li>They shall be called as methods of server, or server like object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On test completion, shutdown the server, disconnect the database
<ul>
<li>a nice teardown (though our db might be in memory or temporary file)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internationalisation / Localisation
<ul>
<li>The request shall be able to send `Accepted-Language` header, and the response must respect it.</li>
<li>Should have some kind of localised strings file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project shall be
<ul>
<li>structured to
<ul>
<li>entry-point.&lt;java|ts|go|js|py&gt;, (say main)</li>
<li>and folders like routes/, models/, controllers/, repository/ (business logic), and /services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>with rather limited package dependency</li>
<li>compile/runnable and testable with simple commands, small script, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic auth endpoints, sessions, tokens, etc. without JWT (I personally dislike JWT)</li>
</ol>
