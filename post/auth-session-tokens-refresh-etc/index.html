Do not use JWT (Just DON&rsquo;T)
Always have a sessions table

Which belongs to the USER

i.e., sessions table has a user_id column


Have access_token and refresh_token

ideally as varchar(256), not text
do not allow them to grow
security shall be mostly based on rotation, not purely on length


Must have access_token_expires_at and refresh_token_expires at columns (both datetime, and keep them as UTC)

make sure to have these columns calculated during the creation of the session. Do not think of doing &ldquo;time-math&rdquo; for calculating expiry.

Because, you may login with one server, but the next server you have the auth checked might have a different time stamp/zone




access/refresh tokens shall be unique


From the above, it becomes possible to have multiple active sessions for one user.

If that is not desired, restrict that at code level, not at DB level


Generate random strings for access token and refresh token

keep them URLsafe (you&rsquo;ll thank me when you have a mobile app)
Keep them about 256 char long

no longer
no shorter




Make access_expiry in a few minutes, and refresh_expiry in a few days
Standard auth is having authorisation header

Authorisation: Bearer &lt;access-token&gt;


Refresh token will require

Authorisation: Bearer &lt;refresh-token&gt;


Deal with Auth always in a middleware and keep the logged in user, or the session found by looking up the access_token (or refresh_token) in the sessions table
On refresh, delete the current session object, and create a new one with new

access_token, and new expiry in a few minutes
refresh_token, with new expiry in a few days


Disallow refresh if the refresh token is already expired
So, if a user logs in and is inactive for a few days, the refresh token expires, and they will have to login fresh again
But as long as the user does a &ldquo;refresh&rdquo; before the refresh-token is expired, they will have sessions alive always.
